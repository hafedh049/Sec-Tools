   - **Purpose**: Network debugging and exploration.
   - **Usage**: Can be used for port scanning, banner grabbing, and setting up listeners.
   - **Syntax Examples**:
     - Banner grabbing:
       ```bash
       nc -v <target> <port>
       ```
     - Port scan:
       ```bash
       nc -zv <target> 1-65535
       ```
   - **When to Use**: Use Netcat for banner grabbing or lightweight port scanning when Nmap is not suitable.

`Netcat` (often abbreviated as `nc`) is a versatile networking utility used for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. It can be used for various tasks such as network debugging, port scanning, and data transfer.

1. **Basic TCP Connection:**
   - **Description:** Open a TCP connection to a specified host and port.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     nc example.com 80
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     nc google.com 80
     ```
   - **Output:** Opens a connection to the specified port on the target host. You can then manually send data or commands.

2. **Listen on a Port (Server Mode):**
   - **Description:** Listen for incoming TCP connections on a specified port.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 1234
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 5555
     ```
   - **Output:** Listens on port `1234` (or `5555`) for incoming connections. It can be used to receive data.

3. **Listen on a Port and Output to a File:**
   - **Description:** Save incoming data to a file.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 1234 > received_data.txt
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 5555 > data_received.txt
     ```
   - **Output:** Receives data on port `1234` (or `5555`) and saves it to `received_data.txt` (or `data_received.txt`).

4. **Send Data to a Host:**
   - **Description:** Send data to a specific host and port.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     echo "Hello, World!" | nc example.com 80
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     echo "GET / HTTP/1.1" | nc google.com 80
     ```
   - **Output:** Sends the specified data to the target host on the given port.

5. **Port Scanning:**
   - **Description:** Scan a range of ports on a target host.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     nc -zv example.com 20-80
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     nc -zv google.com 1-100
     ```
   - **Output:** Scans ports `20` to `80` (or `1` to `100`) on the target host, reporting which ports are open.

6. **UDP Connection:**
   - **Description:** Open a UDP connection to a specified host and port.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     nc -u example.com 1234
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     nc -u google.com 53
     ```
   - **Output:** Opens a UDP connection to the specified port on the target host. You can then send and receive UDP packets.

7. **Create a Simple Chat:**
   - **Description:** Set up a simple chat server and client using `netcat`.
   - **Server:**
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 1234
     ```
   - **Client:**
     ```bash
     nc example.com 1234
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 5555
     nc google.com 5555
     ```
   - **Output:** Both server and client can send and receive messages, creating a basic chat application.

8. **Transfer Files:**
   - **Description:** Transfer files between hosts using `netcat`.
   - **Sender:**
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 1234 < file_to_send.txt
     ```
   - **Receiver:**
     ```bash
     nc example.com 1234 > received_file.txt
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 5555 < document.txt
     nc google.com 5555 > document_received.txt
     ```
   - **Output:** Sends the file `file_to_send.txt` from the sender and saves it as `received_file.txt` on the receiver.

9. **Show Help and Options:**
   - **Description:** Display available commands and options for `netcat`.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     nc -h
     ```
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     nc -h
     ```
   - **Output:** Lists available commands and options with descriptions.

### **Installation**

`Netcat` is often pre-installed on many Unix-like systems. If not, you can typically install it via your package manager:

```bash
# For Debian-based systems
sudo apt-get install netcat

# For Red Hat-based systems
sudo yum install nc

# For macOS using Homebrew
brew install netcat
```

### **Usage Notes**

- `Netcat` is a powerful and flexible tool, but it can be used for malicious purposes if not handled responsibly. Always use it within the bounds of legal and ethical guidelines.
- The `-v` (verbose) option provides additional output for debugging and detailed operation.
